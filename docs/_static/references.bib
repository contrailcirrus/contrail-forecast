  abstract = {The global annual mean contrail climate forcing may exceed that of aviation's cumulative CO2 emissions. As only 2 \%--3 \% of all flights are likely responsible for 80 \% of the global annual contrail energy forcing (EFcontrail), re-routing these flights could reduce the occurrence of strongly warming contrails. Here, we develop a contrail forecasting tool that produces global maps of persistent contrail formation and their EFcontrail formatted to align with standard weather and turbulence forecasts for integration into existing flight planning and air traffic management workflows. This is achieved by extending the existing trajectory-based contrail cirrus prediction model (CoCiP), which simulates contrails formed along flight paths, to a grid-based approach that initializes an infinitesimal contrail segment at each point in a 4D spatiotemporal grid and tracks them until their end of life. Outputs are provided for N aircraft-engine groups, with groupings based on similarities in aircraft mass and engine particle number emissions: N=7 results in a 3 \% mean error between the trajectory- and grid-based CoCiP, while N=3 facilitates operational simplicity but increases the mean error to 13 \%. We use the grid-based CoCiP to simulate contrails globally using 2019 meteorology and compare its forecast patterns with those from previous studies. Two approaches are proposed to apply these forecasts for contrail mitigation: (i) monetizing EFcontrail and including it as an additional cost parameter within a flight trajectory optimizer or (ii) constructing polygons to avoid airspace volumes with strongly warming contrails. We also demonstrate a probabilistic formulation of the grid-based CoCiP by running it with ensemble meteorology and excluding grid cells with significant uncertainties in the simulated EFcontrail. This study establishes a working standard for incorporating contrail mitigation into flight management protocols and demonstrates how forecasting uncertainty can be incorporated to minimize unintended consequences associated with increased CO2 emissions from re-routes.},

  abstract = {Aircraft condensation trails, also known as contrails, contribute a substantial portion of aviation's overall climate footprint. Contrail impacts can be reduced through smart flight planning that avoids contrail-forming regions of the atmosphere. While previous studies have explored the operational impacts of contrail avoidance in simulated environments, this paper aims to characterize the feasibility and cost of contrail avoidance precisely within a commercial flight planning system. This study leverages the commercial Flightkeys 5D algorithm, developed by Flightkeys GmbH, with a prototypical contrail forecast model based on the Contrail Cirrus Prediction (CoCiP) model to simulate contrail avoidance on 49 411 flights during the first two weeks of June 2023, and 35 429 flights during the first two weeks of January 2024. The utilization of a commercial flight planning system enables high-accuracy estimates of additional cost and fuel investments by operators to achieve estimated reductions in contrail-energy forcing and overall flight global warming potential. The results show that navigational contrail avoidance will require minimal additional cost (0.08\%) and fuel (0.11\%) investments to achieve notable reductions in contrail climate forcing (-73.0\%). This simulation provides evidence that contrail mitigation entails very low operational risks, even regarding fuel. This study aims to serve as an incentive for operators and air traffic controllers to initiate contrail mitigation testing as soon as possible and begin reducing aviation's non- emissions.},

  abstract = {Persistent contrails make up a large fraction of aviation's contribution to global warming. We describe a scalable, automated detection and matching (ADM) system to determine from satellite data whether a flight has made a persistent contrail. The ADM system compares flight segments to contrails detected by a computer vision algorithm running on images from the GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager. We develop a flight matching algorithm and use it to label each flight segment as a match or non-match. We perform this analysis on 1.6 million flight segments. The result is an analysis of which flights make persistent contrails several orders of magnitude larger than any previous work. We assess the agreement between our labels and available prediction models based on weather forecasts. Shifting air traffic to avoid regions of contrail formation has been proposed as a possible mitigation with the potential for very low cost/ton-CO2e. Our findings suggest that imperfections in these prediction models increase this cost/ton by about an order of magnitude. Contrail avoidance is a cost-effective climate change mitigation even with this factor taken into account, but our results quantify the need for more accurate contrail prediction methods and establish a benchmark for future development.},

However, existing satellite products measuring broadband outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and reflected shortwave radiation (RSR) have spatio-temporal resolutions that are too coarse to evaluate important radiative forcers like aircraft condensation trails. We present a neural network which estimates OLR and RSR based on narrowband radiances, using collocated Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) data. The resulting estimates feature strong agreement with the CERES data products ({$R$}2 = 0.977 for OLR and 0.974 for RSR on CERES Level 2 footprints), and we provide open access to the collocated satellite data and model outputs on all available GOES-16 ABI data for the 4 years from 2018--2021.},

  abstract = {Previous work has shown that while the net effect of aircraft condensation trails (contrails) on the climate is warming, the exact magnitude of the energy forcing per meter of contrail remains uncertain. In this paper, we explore the skill of a Lagrangian contrail model (CoCiP) in identifying flight segments with high contrail energy forcing. We find that skill is greater than climatological predictions alone, even accounting for uncertainty in weather fields and model parameters. We estimate the uncertainty due to humidity by using the ensemble ERA5 weather reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) as Monte Carlo inputs to CoCiP. We unbias and correct under-dispersion on the ERA5 humidity data by forcing a match to the distribution of in situ humidity measurements taken at cruising altitude. We take CoCiP energy forcing estimates calculated using one of the ensemble members as a proxy for ground truth, and report the skill of CoCiP in identifying segments with large positive proxy energy forcing. We further estimate the uncertainty due to model parameters in CoCiP by performing Monte Carlo simulations with CoCiP model parameters drawn from uncertainty distributions consistent with the literature. When CoCiP outputs are averaged over seasons to form climatological predictions, the skill in predicting the proxy is 44\%, while the skill of per-flight CoCiP outputs is 84\%. If these results carry over to the true (unknown) contrail EF, they indicate that per-flight energy forcing predictions can reduce the number of potential contrail avoidance route adjustments by 2x, hence reducing both the cost and fuel impact of contrail avoidance.},

  abstract = {The current best-estimate of the global annual mean radiative forcing (RF) attributable to contrail cirrus is thought to be 3 times larger than the RF from aviation's cumulative CO2 emissions. Here, we simulate the global contrail RF for 2019--2021 using reanalysis weather data and improved engine emission estimates along actual flight trajectories derived from Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast telemetry. Our 2019 global annual mean contrail net RF (62.1 mW m-2) is 44 \% lower than current best estimates for 2018 (111 [33, 189] mW m-2, 95 \% confidence interval). Regionally, the contrail net RF is largest over Europe (876 mW m-2) and the USA (414 mW m-2), while the RF values over East Asia (64 mW m-2) and China (62 mW m-2) are close to the global average, because fewer flights in these regions form persistent contrails resulting from lower cruise altitudes and limited ice supersaturated regions in the subtropics due to the Hadley Circulation. Globally, COVID-19 reduced the flight distance flown and contrail net RF in 2020 (-43 \% and -56 \%, respectively, relative to 2019) and 2021 (-31 \% and -49 \%, respectively) with significant regional variations. Around 14 \% of all flights in 2019 formed a contrail with a net warming effect, yet only 2 \% of all flights caused 80 \% of the annual contrail energy forcing. The spatiotemporal patterns of the most strongly warming and cooling contrail segments can be attributed to flight scheduling, engine particle number emissions, tropopause height, and background radiation fields. Our contrail RF estimates are most sensitive to corrections applied to the global humidity fields, followed by assumptions on the engine particle number emissions, and are least sensitive to radiative heating effects on the contrail plume and contrail--contrail overlapping. Using this sensitivity analysis, we estimate that the 2019 global contrail net RF could range between 34.8 and 74.8 mW m-2.},
